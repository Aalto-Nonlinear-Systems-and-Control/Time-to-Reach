# Time-to-Reach

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of benchmarks for time-to-reach analysis in dynamical systems. The benchmarks cover various types of reachability analysis problems and are primarily used for comparing the performance and accuracy of different reachability analysis approaches.

## Documentation

For detailed information about each benchmark, including:

- System specifications and dynamics
- Initial conditions and target sets
- Analysis methods and tools used
- Performance results and comparisons
- Visualization

Please refer to the **`Benchmark_Specifications.pdf`** file, which provides comprehensive documentation for all benchmarks and their corresponding results.
